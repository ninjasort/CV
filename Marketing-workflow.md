## Marketing workflow

**Research** - I always start with keyword research to determine the best keywords to target. This helps with SEO and ranking on search engines like Google and Bing. I spend time reading other popular blog posts and researching the topic to find important and relevant content.

**Strategy** - I start all posts with an outline and a strategy that involves prompting the key questions that the post will answer. I structure the post with a bulleted list of sections and questions that I'll answer throughout the post. I'll use these questions to guide my creativity and writing process.

**Production** - I can produce high quality copywriting, media selection, along with screen recordings and video walkthroughs of a software product or business strategy. I can write on technical topics and other business, marketing, or e-commerce related themes.

**Revise & Publish** - For the revision phase, I offer 1-2 prompt revision rounds for each post where needed. I can update any spelling, grammar, or style related discrepancies to improve the quality and match your request.
